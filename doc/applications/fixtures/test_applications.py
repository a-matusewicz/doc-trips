", "application_header": "Welcome to the First-Year Trips Croo and Trip Leader application!  We hope this application will provide you with an opportunity to reflect on your time at Dartmouth and share some of your thoughts about building community here.  Everyone can play a role in welcoming new students to Dartmouth, so through this application we are hoping to gain an understanding of what you might bring to the role of a Trip Leader or croo member in order to create an inclusive, thoughtful, fun, and safe Trips experience this year. We would like to emphasize that there is no specific \u201ctype\u201d of person who would make a good Trip Leader or crooling. You do not have to be \u201coutdoorsy\u201d or extroverted. We consider anyone and everyone.  That being said, we are looking for people who are thoughtful and genuine in their responses. \r\n\r\nAlso, we encourage you to apply for both Trip Leader and croos as the applications are very similar. Some questions on the croo and the leader applications are identical. You may use the same answers on both apps for those questions. But MAKE SURE the questions are the exact same before reusing an answer. \r\n\r\nA team of reviewers who have prior experience with the Trips program will read your application and assign a score.

However, in addition to this, I think more can be done to make trippees more comfortable and have more open discussion on trips. As a trippee my freshman year, I remember wanting to know why about many things. Why are we being \"raided\" and are people dressed up in princess and dragon costumes on this bridge? Why do they give us the foods they do on trips? I think this explanation and focus on the meaning of trips is done so well at the Lodge by Lodge croo, but I think trip leaders could receive more training and have more discussion about the meaning of trips before going on them and leading a group of freshmen. I think having this mindset of trip leaders explaining things to trippees will foster more than just the blind trust in this system of trips, but a trust built on communication and mutual respect between leaders and trippees.

However, what I observed in both my individual trip section and at the lodj is that international students have little interaction with kids from New England, California and everywhere else in between. Both my trip sections where primarily a collection of international students who were just introduced to more international students. This ultimately is a disservice to kids who are traveling great lengths to come to Dartmouth because their scope of the community is limited. Although you are not contracted to only stay friends with those you make on trips, I know from my experience living in an exclusively international dorm on my FSP, that it is easy and more comfortable to remain with people who are in a similar state. The transition to Dartmouth is vastly different for my trippees who came from Korea and Ghana than it is for a student who comes from CT. Because the experience is very novel, international students are less inclined to meet a new group of kids if they are exclusively introduced to other students who are in the same boat over trips. I understand there are scheduling conflicts with pre-orientation but their trips experience is important too.

First, I wish there were more section gatherings on campus throughout freshman year. I met a lot of awesome people on my first and last days of Trips who I had trouble finding again, and it would be nice to have more section solidarity. There were much-appreciated section dinners at the lodj last year, but it would\u2019ve been nice to have something closer to campus as well! For those freshmen who may not come away with lasting friendships from their Trip, section gatherings might give them the opportunity to reconnect with more people and make the social experience more positive. I\u2019m glad that the Connections Croo can make more of these gatherings happen.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, one way I see Trips improving its inclusivity is to expand the variety of Trip types to include options beyond the traditionally physically rigorous Trips of the past. The Trip options might seem limited to students who have not spent much time in nature, especially those who have grown up in urban environments. Many students come to campus not knowing how to ride bikes or swim, for example, and trips should aim to foster a sense of belonging that all students can access. I led a community service trip last year that one of my trippees was physically unprepared for. This trip, seemingly accommodating of the range of physical activity to which incoming freshmen are accustomed, largely resembled hiking 3 and provided an environment in which my trippee encountered unnecessary obstacles to a positive trips experience that culminated in his being evacuated. I am confident that the caring leadership of the Trips program can do better at providing comfortable opportunities for each student and appropriate Trips matches. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think there should be more small group conversations like the ones at the Lodj, and that there should be a more conscious effort to make Trips a safe space. I find the sense of place talks some of the bravest and most genuine programming I have witnessed at Dartmouth, and these talks stayed with me through my first terms at Dartmouth, reminding me that it was okay to feel lost, or to feel I did not belong. The Trips program\u2019s enthusiasm for Dartmouth makes it beloved, and those involved in Trips call Dartmouth homes for unique, wonderful reasons. Yet I think aspects of Trips (as well as other programs like Dimensions) can unrealistically raise the expectations of trippees, especially as the integrity of trippees\u2019 communities becomes complicated back on campus. Of course, I was motivated on the trips I\u2019ve led to encourage my trippees\u2019 excitement about coming to Dartmouth and to assuage their nerves, but I also wanted to share with them the hardships I\u2019d faced, and advice I wish I\u2019d known, and the possibility of criticizing Dartmouth and still loving it.", "in_goodstanding_with_college": true, "trippee_confidentiality": true, "role_preference": "PREFER_CROO", "medical_certifications": "", "trips_year": 2015, "summer_training_ok": false, "tshirt_size": "S", "from_where": "New York City", "hanover_in_fall": "YES", "race_ethnicity": "white", "allergen_information": "nuts + kiwi - oral reaction, swelling but not anaphylactic shock.\r\nhorses - eye swelling", "phone": "9175730437", "spring_training_ok": true, "applicant": 573, "dietary_restrictions": "tree nuts (ok with peanuts and hazelnuts), kiwi, horses", "peer_training": "IGD\r\n\r\nMAV this year", "personal_activities": "At Dartmouth: Big Brother Big Sister, Dartmouth Food Connection, admissions tour guide, Breakthrough Collaborative Campus Leader, Kappa Kappa Gamma Sorority (Vice President of Standards), Presidential Scholar conducting research in the English department, Voices cast member 15W\r\n\r\nOutside Dartmouth, I seek out teaching experience, interning at various schools over summers and this past winter break.

I love to do yoga with my roommate because it calms me down and relaxation is very important in the college experience. Finally, I have worked both on my own and with small trail conservation groups (based in the Enfield Shaker Village and around the Upper Valley) to map and maintain trails (marking them and clearing fallen trees and debris).", "assigned_trip": null, "available_triptypes": [1, 3, 25, 26, 17, 5, 4, 23, 12, 14, 7, 28, 11], "trips_year": 2015, "document": "Trip_Leader_Application_2015_fHgaS7I.docx", "available_sections": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "preferred_sections": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "trip_preference_comments": "I am pretty much equally split between any of the trips that I prefer, but I am most strongly suited to either the nature writing/ art, nature exploration, or one of the watersport trips, because these are all activities that i have experience in and do frequently during my free time in the summer.", "risk_management": null, "community_building": null}, "model": "applications.leadersupplement"}, {"pk": 56, "fields": {"first_aid": null, "preferred_triptypes": [], "wilderness_skills": null, "application": 56, "cannot_participate_in": "", "relevant_experience": "", "assigned_trip": null, "available_triptypes": [], "trips_year": 2015, "document": "", "available_sections": [], "preferred_sections": [], "trip_preference_comments": "", "risk_management": null, "community_building": null}, "model": "applications.leadersupplement"}, {"pk": 57, "fields": {"first_aid": null, "preferred_triptypes": [3, 6, 19, 12], "wilderness_skills": null, "application": 57, "cannot_participate_in": "", "relevant_experience": "", "assigned_trip": null, "available_triptypes": [1, 3, 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 5, 4, 12, 7], "trips_year": 2015, "document": "", "available_sections": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "preferred_sections": [1, 2, 3, 7, 10], "trip_preference_comments": "", "risk_management": null, "community_building": null}, "model": "applications.leadersupplement"}, {"pk": 58, "fields": {"first_aid": null, "preferred_triptypes": [], "wilderness_skills": null, "application": 58, "cannot_participate_in": "", "relevant_experience": "", "assigned_trip": null, "available_triptypes": [], "trips_year": 2015, "document": "", "available_sections": [], "preferred_sections": [], "trip_preference_comments": "", "risk_management": null, "community_building": null}, "model": "applications.leadersupplement"}, {"pk": 59, "fields": {"first_aid": null, "preferred_triptypes": [5], "wilderness_skills": null, "application": 59, "cannot_participate_in": "I have no experience with canoeing, fishing, mountain biking, horseback riding, whitewater kayaking, trail work, or very strenuous hiking, so I'm not sure how effective I'd be on these trips.", "relevant_experience": "Kayaking Flatwater: I led this trip in 2014, and I instructed flatwater kayaking every day at a summer camp during the summer between my senior year of high school and freshman year of college.\r\n\r\nCabin Camping: I have co-led a cabin camping trip in the Cabin & Trail sub club of the Dartmouth Outing Club.\r\n\r\nHiking 1 and 2: I have co-led several easy to moderate hikes through the Cabin & Trail sub club of the Dartmouth Outing Club.\r\n\r\nRopes Course: I instructed ropes course every day at a summer camp during the summer between my senior year of high school and freshman year of college.\r\n\r\nOrganic Farming: I do not have any direct experience with organic farming, but I got to observe a lot of the farm techniques while staying at this campsite during my flatwater kayaking trip, and if I am assigned to this trip, I will participate in farm activities during my sophomore summer in order to gain a better understanding of the farm.", "assigned_trip": null, "available_triptypes": [1, 17, 18, 7, 28], "trips_year": 2015, "document": "", "available_sections": [8, 9], "preferred_sections": [10], "trip_preference_comments": "Because the summer term starts and ends later this year, finals technically don't end until September 1.

I am very experienced with the technical systems involved in climbing and I plan to spend a lot of time climbing this spring and summer. Climbing inherently presents opportunities for hiking, whether on the approach to a crag, on an alpine style climb, or simply to explore the area around rock formations. I am comfortable with hiking 10+ miles per day and I try to stay in good shape for these outdoor activities. I am a leader in training for the Dartmouth Mountaineering Club and plan to become a leader before next fall.\r\n\r\nCabin Camping: Cooking is one of my favorite parts about camping, and the beautiful kitchens in most of the DOC cabins are enticing! I went on a cabin camping trip for my first year trip and I would enjoy introducing new students to outdoor activities in this environment.\r\n\r\nKayaking Whitewater: I had some whitewater experience coming into Dartmouth, and the easy access to equipment through Ledyard has allowed me to enhance my skills and become more comfortable in a boat. I paddled a few times at Hartland this past fall at various water levels and I have paddled on the Gallatin River in Montana and on the Snake River in Wyoming. I hope to gain more experience in whitewater this spring and summer and to become a trip leader for Ledyard.\r\n\r\nKayaking Flatwater / Canoeing / Fishing: Growing up in Minnesota, I spent a lot of time during my childhood partaking in these activities.

I am well versed in the technical aspects of fishing and paddling and could readily teach these skills to my peers.\r\n\r\nMountain Biking: I spent a lot of time mountain biking earlier in my teenage years and I have been on a few biking trips at Dartmouth.
