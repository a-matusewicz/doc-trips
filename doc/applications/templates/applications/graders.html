<p> Sweet! You're helping us grade applications. Boy are there a lot of them... We will feed you random applications to grade. You should skip an application if you recognize the applicant. </p>

<h4><a href="{% url 'applications:grade:next_leader' %}"> Grade Trip Leader Applications </a></h4>
<h4><a href="{% url 'applications:grade:next_croo' %}"> Grade Croo Applications </a></h4>

<h3> Croo Heads </h3>
<p> Use the following links if you are a Croo head and are trying to grade applications for your Croo. You will only be shown applications which other graders have indicated are a good match for your Croo. Everyone else, stay away!</p>
{% for croo in croos %}
<h5><a href="{% url 'applications:grade:next_croo' croo_pk=croo.pk %}"> Grade {{ croo }} Applications </a><h5>
