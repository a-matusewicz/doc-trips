  <h2> Grade Croo and Leader Applications </h2>
</div>

<p> Sweet! You're helping us grade applications. Boy are there a lot of them... We will feed you random applications to grade; you will grade each application no more than once. You should skip an application if you recognize the applicant. </p>

<h4><a href="{% url 'applications:grade:next_leader' %}"> Grade Trip Leader Applications </a></h4>
<h4><a href="{% url 'applications:grade:next_croo' %}"> Grade Croo Applications </a></h4>

<h3> Croo Heads </h3>
<p> Use the following links if you are a Croo head. Everyone else, stay away! You will only be shown applications which other graders believe have the following qualifications:</p>
{% for qual in qualifications %}
<h5><a href="{% url 'applications:grade:next_croo' qualification_pk=qual.pk %}"> Grade {{ qual }} Applications </a><h5>
{% endfor %}
