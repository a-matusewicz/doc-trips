<p> Read the application completely before assigning it a score:
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    {% for score in score_choices %}
    <li> {{ score }} </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</p>

<p> Justify your score in the <strong>comments</strong> section. Specifically articulate why you gave the score you did and list important hard/soft skills that set this applicant apart. Details and examples are way more important than generalizations. You should use the <strong>scratchpad</strong> to take notes on/score specific questions. Although we may come back to read these scratchpad notes when we're finalizing Leaders and Croos, we're primarily going to look at the <strong>comments</strong> section.</p>

<p> If you recognize an applicant who you know, you should skip it. </p>
