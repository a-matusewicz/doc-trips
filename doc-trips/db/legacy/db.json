Once the road turns away from the river, you'll enter a marshy area - just stay on the widest part of the river. Soon you will see the Diamond Peaks ahead. These formations are in the Second College Grant, where you'll be spending the night. Continue on the river until you have left the Diamond Peaks behind you. The river will bend gently left and off of the right bank is a large blow down with trees and a huge pile of rocks. This comes up quicker than expected so start looking for the pile of rocks as soon as you start paddling. Park your canoes on the downstream side of the blow down. Climb the bank and make camp on or along the Miller/Quinn Memorial Landing Strip. If it looks like rain, try setting up canoe-tents that deflect rainwater because the trees are too dense for solid waterproof shelter in the event of a downpour. What are canoe-tents?

About half a mile downstream, the Swift Diamond River (which runs through the Grant) joins the Magalloway. After another 2 miles you'll pass under the Route 16 bridge. When you enter a large marshy area, be sure to stay on the main river. If you're in doubt, go straight or slightly left; there is one very confusing junction where you go straight - make no sharp right or left turns. After a stretch of many houses on the right bank, make a sharp right turn where there will be more houses on the right. Around another bend, you'll see the paved road again (Route 16). After this point, continue straight along the right bank for about one mile. The river will swell out on the left, with a small island in the middle. Stay on the right. Continue on the main river past another marshy area, toward Lake Umbagog. You have a beautiful afternoon stretch of water ahead of you now, and huge wildlife viewing potential! Paddle down the Magalloway toward Lake Umbagog. Watch out for marshy areas on either side - particularly a large pool on the right; the Magalloway runs fairly straight. Take care around the marshy junction of the Magalloway and big, wide Lake Umbagog; the landmarks can be confusing and you might miss the well protected nesting site of the only known wild living bald eagles in New Hampshire. Once you have paddled into the lake, stay on the western bank and head south. Continue south beyond the mouth of the Androscoggin around the point and past the little island. Keep canoeing past the point south, passing Molls Rock. Your campsite will be labeled R31, this is your campsite! Pay careful attention to the map and be patient. Look at your search as an adventure and an opportunity to paddle in a beautiful lake! The campsites are numbered with white paint on the rocks, the numbers are about four inches high. Once you have found your site, you can head ashore and set up camp or continue exploring in your canoes.

Really, any where downriver of the merge is best.  Remember, the cooler the water the better!\r\n   B) the Magalloway River via the Landing Strip:  There's some nice pools at the south end of the landing strip.  Or, if you cross over the strip and head down a gradual embankment, some nice fishing can be had off the banks of the Magalloway right there.  In this river, you'll find not only Trout, but also Bass or maybe even Perch!\r\n\r\n2) Fish Type: In the Swift Diamond and the Dead Diamond Rivers, you'll only find the typical NH Brook Trout, fully grown between 8 and 13 inches (though rumor has it that a 20 inch trout has been caught in the Grant recently).  These guys like cool water, so if you see a deep pool or shady spot to fish in, you'll have better luck finding them there.  If you really want to up your chances, try fishing early in the morning or later towards the evening - it's cooler at theses times, and the fish will be more active, after sleeping during the day to beat the morning heat.\r\n\r\nRestrictions:  In the area between the merge of the Diamond Rivers and their joining into the Magalloway, there's a catch-and-release policy in place. In all other parts of the Grant and surroundings, there's a two fish / day suggested limit.  Also in that area, you not allowed to use hooks with barbs.\r\n\r\nFly vs. not-Fly fishing:  The fishing gear that DOC Trips has is not fly fishing gear.  That said, if your trippees bring fly fishing gear and know how to use it, there's no reason why they can't!  Advise them (if they don't know already) that they'll be most successful with \"wet\" flies (so, the ones that sink underwater rather than float on top of it).  Going along with the \"trout like to be coooool\" theme, having the fly sink into the deeper, cooler water will give you better chances of finding a fish.  They're too hot to be playing around and jumping at the surface at this time of year.\r\n\r\nSWIMMING ON TRIPS:\r\n-Swimming is allowed ONLY if your trippee has taken and passed the swim test, and note the swimming ability of your trippees during the swim test.\r\n- If your trippee did not take the swim test but is comfortable swimming, they may be allowed to wade (wading does NOT equal swimming).

(And most of it is downhill!) The all-knowing AMC White Mountain Guide writes that \"the views from Bondcliff are unsurpassed in the White Mountains\". Hope for clear weather--\r\n    Head back up the campsite spur trail to the Bondcliff trail, continuing left (south) on the Bondcliff trail. After 0.2 miles, you'll reach the West Bond spur trail. Stash your gear out of sight and jaunt up this side trail for some wonderful vistas. The round trip is one mile, and it's worth it. Rejoin Bondcliff and travel half a mile to the summit of Mount Bond. Stop, ponder, and feel extremely lucky that you go to a school so close to the White Mountains. Be wary of this next part of the trail in bad weather, as it is fairly exposed for a mile or so. Continue on along the cliffs of Bondcliff (1.2 mi) and then descend 4.4 miles until you hit the Wilderness Trail. \r\n    Turn right and head 1.8 miles West on the Wilderness Trail towards Franconia Falls -- you'll be traveling next to the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River. Shortly after the Franconia Brook trail merges into the Wilderness Trail, you'll find a bridge leading over Franconia Brook. Hike across the bridge and then right (North) up a small path following the river upstream to Franconia Falls, the greatest waterslide in the Whites! Sit down and slide over the Falls! If you bring a lunch tray, these things are Disneyland + amazing. (IMPORTANT: be very careful at Franconia Falls.  People drown there every year--it can be very dangerous, esp. if the water level is high, so be extra vigilant.)\r\n\r\nYour next task is to find the your home for the night, the Franconia Brook Tentsite\u2013 Take the Wilderness Trail back the way you came, across the Franconia Brook Bridge. Just after you cross the bridge and see signs for the Wilderness boundary, there is a narrow trail leading to the right to cross the Pemigewasset River. Cross this river on big stones (you MAY have to ford the river a little bit - it can be knee deep).  Be very careful, go slow, and be extra cautious.  Give Vox a call if you have any questions.  \r\n\r\nIF THE RIVER LOOKS MORE THAN KNEE DEEP DO NOT CROSS. Just camp on that side of the river 200 feet from the trail and walk out on the trail on that side of the river (there is a trail on either side of the river.\r\n\r\n You'll be at the north end of the campground (along the Eastside Trail) after you cross the river. If you have problems finding the campground OR the river is too dangerous to cross(be sure that you camp at least 200 ft. from the trail. If the river is above your knees it might not be worth crossing, if you do cross, have everyone unbuckle their packs, that way if they fall in they can get their pack off. Do not have them take their boots off unless they have sturdy soled sandals (like Tevas or Chacos)  not worth cutting your feet to keep your feet dry. \r\n\r\nThere have been reports of bears in this area so again plan on hanging a bear bag!\r\n\r\nNote: If you are moving slowly today, (ex. if there's some weather happening while you're descending from the Bondcliff, slowing things down), you can stop to make camp 1.8 miles before the Franconia Brook Tentsite, at the junction of Bondcliff Trail and Wilderness Trail.  Just across from that trail junction (just cross the Wilderness Trail, don't turn onto it) are some small, unmarked trails that lead down to the river and the old Camp 16 campsite (where Trip 57 has stayed in the past).  Camp 16 is no longer in use, so if you've decided to stay here for the night, try to find another suitable campsite near this area.  Be sure to camp at least 200 ft. from the trail AND the river.  Find a flat, clear site and set up your tarp.  Please do not build a campfire here (or at any other time on your trip).  From here, you have a 4.7 mile hike out tomorrow morning.

Carrigain is named after Philip Carrigain of Concord, New Hampshire.  Carrigain was born in Concord in 1772 and died there in 1842.  He was a graduate of Dartmouth College and became the N.H. Secretary of State between 1805 and 1810.  In 1816 he published what was then the most complete map of New Hampshire.  However, that map did not identify Mt. Washington, which had been known by that name since 1784.\r\n\r\nPemigewasset is an Abenaki word meaning \u201cRapidly Moving.\u201d", "return_route": 2, "revision_notes": "Revised 9/94 \u00c3\u00b1 CPT; 8/95 \u00c3\u00b1 HH; 7/04 - AGR; 9/05 - VJA; 8/27 - PJG ; DLS 07/10\r\n\r\nSwimming MRB 7/10", "triptype": 19, "dropoff": 64, "non_swimmers_allowed": true, "description_day1": "(8.7 miles)\r\n\r\nDriving south on Route 302, look sharp for a brown trail sign and small parking area on the right side of the road.

After following a logging road for a bit and diverging left to cross a small brook, you'll soon turn right off the road to cross Halfway Brook.  The trail will continue past the White Mountain National Forest boundary, marked by a large pile of red-painted stones.  Here the trail enters and follows an old logging road along Nancy Brook, crossing the brook on the rocks at 1.6 miles (crossing may be difficult at high water, use caution!).  At 1.8 miles, you'll pass the remains of the Lucy mill.  Above here the old road virtually disappears, and the trail ascends through a rough area of landslides, recrosses Nancy Brook, and soon reaches the foot of Nancy Cascades at 2.4 miles!  Stop to eat and appreciate the beauty! \r\nYou'll turn sharp left at the pool - climb steeply along and past the Cascades and continue through virgin spruce.  You'll soon arrive at the northeast shore of Nancy Pond (3.4 miles).  Continue on the trail, skirting the north shore of the pond, and after about a mile discover Norcross Pond.  Note the natural damn and wonderful view at the end of the pond (4.5 mi).  Both ponds may have giardia, so treat water before drinking.  Continue as the trail descends gradually to the west on a logging road.  At 6 miles, the trail veers right, crosses Norcross Brook (may be difficult in high water), then shortly reaches an old railroad bed and swings left onto it.  At 6.4 miles, it crosses Anderson Brook (may be difficult in high water), then at 6.8 miles turns left off the railroad grade and crosses the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River on a bridge.  Soon now you'll meet the Carrigain Notch Trail - make a right.  After 0.7 miles the Carrigain Notch Trail will make a sharp right where the Desolation Trail continues straight across a brook.

Continue along the Desolation trail, climbing STEEPLY to the summit of Mt. Carrigain (1.9 mi). Make sure that you get enough water from the brook before you start. (There will NOT be any water on the mountain, no matter what the guidebooks tell you.) Admire the excellent view from the top of Mount Carrigain's fire tower, also a great place for lunch or a snack. (From this point, you can see all but two or three of NH's 4,000ft White Mountain peaks.) Once you're done taking in the view, return down the Desolation trail and repack for the second half of the day.\r\n\r\nReturn to the Carrigain Notch Trail and take what will now be a sharp left off Desolation (towards the northwest).  In less than a mile, you'll reach Stillwater Junction - turn left (south) to continue on the Wilderness Trail.  This section of the trail is a nice, flat mosey along the East Branch of the Pemi River.  2.6 miles past the Junction, you'll see the Thoreau Falls Trail diverge north from the Wilderness Trail.  About one mile beyond the Thoreau Trail you'll encounter the Pemi River again, as well as the site of a recently removed suspension bridge over the river.   DO NOT CROSS THE RIVER HERE.  Instead, turn left off the Wilderness Trail onto the Cedar Brook Trail.  After .6 miles, turn right off the Cedar Brook Trail onto the Pemi East Side Trail (this junction might be a bit overgrown, but there should be a sign that says \"East Side Trail\" to help you find the path).  Continue on this trail until you come to the Franconia Brook Tentsite (~2 miles).

Prior to that, it had been known as Great Haystack.\r\n\r\nLittle Haystack Mountain is located between Mt. Liberty and Mt. Lincoln on the Franconia Ridge.  The peaks on this ridge, now bearing the names of Liberty, Lincoln, Lafayette, and Garfield, were all originally called \u201cHaystacks\u201d because they resembled piles of hay when seen from the town of Lincoln, NH to the south.\r\n", "return_route": 2, "revision_notes": "revised 9/92 \u00c3\u00b1 SY; 8/93 - MD and EH; 8/95 \u00c3\u00b1 HH; 8/98 AE; 7/04 JBW 7/05 KNJ, 8/09 SAL\r\nSwimming - Maisie 7/10\r\ntiming day 4: ARP '11, EMO 7/12\r\nRevised day 4/exit, Lincoln Woods trail closed - CO 8/13", "triptype": 20, "dropoff": 65, "non_swimmers_allowed": true, "description_day1": "9.1 Miles \r\n\r\nYou will be dropped at the North Twin Trail.

You can walk down West Wheelock Street toward the river & turn right into the parking lot near the Swim Docks/Boathouse. Walk through the parking lot, past the rowing boathouse, and continue down the driveway between the two white buildings toward Tom Dent Cabin.  Walk to the right of Tom Dent Cabin and you will see the start of the Cliff Side Trail.  This trail follows the river and connects to Pine Park.\r\n\r\nStay on the Cliff Side Trail for a little over 2.0 miles.  This trail can be a little narrow & slippery, so go slow & be careful.  There may be some trees crossing the trail, so if you need to climb over a tree - have your trippees remove their packs.  You will pass several private staircases/docks that belong to Hanover residents.  You will cross a clearing that is right at the bank of the river.  Do not turn right into the ravine (it's not a trail), but this can be a great place to take a break & wade into the river (ONLY if your trippees passed the swim test!).  \r\n\r\nAt 2.15 miles, you will come across a small brown building with green pads on the corners and the junction of several trails.  There will be three trails ahead of you -- take the middle trail & continue straight. At a small fork, stay on the trail by bearing slightly to the left.  \r\n\r\nAt ~2.75 miles, the trail turns slightly to the right away from the river (stay on the wide path). At the Y-shaped intersection, go left down the little hill. After 0.2 miles, you will come to an intersection shaped like a triangle, go right to cross the stream/stream bed, not left up the big hill. \r\n\r\nYou will pass under a bridge overhead, and after going under that bridge, take a left through some grass to go up the hill to the golf course. Stay left on the path and head towards the red dirt path in front of you. Be very careful as you will be passing by tees and you don't want to interrupt anyone's game (or get hit!). Don't take a break on the golf course, try to get out of the way and off the course quickly! This path will turn into grass. Get on the paved golf cart path and head to the left. Once you get to the water cooler, take the right fork towards the road (Rt. 10). \r\n\r\nTake a left onto Rt. 10, stay on the sidewalk while walking on the road! You'll come to a roundabout that has the Co-Op market on the corner. If your trip need water, go inside & fill up! Take a right onto Reservoir Road, past the intersection with Hemlock Street (you will have passed the rugby fields & an elementary school). Continue on Reservoir Road until you come across Storr's Pond Road. Make a sharp LEFT and enter the Storr's Pond Recreation Area. \r\n\r\nGo into the first parking lot on your right.  Go all the way to back of that parking lot and there's a building that has a gate to the right of it (gate may be open or closed). Go through or around this gate and continue straight up to the field. You will pass the Woodsmen's Area on your left.\r\n\r\nStraight across the field, there is a wide mowed trail going up the hill, follow that trail straight (NOT to the base of the ski jump, but up the hill).  At the top of the hill, take a left (ignore the one way sign, that's for skiing).  Continue on this wide trail for about 0.3 miles, then you will see a smaller side trail to the left going down hill.  Follow this trail down, and take a right at the bottom of it.  \r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, you will see a treehouse.  This is your camp for the trip!\r\nYou can stay in and around the treehouse however you want to camp.  You can also camp next to the high ropes course (you should be able to see it from the treehouse) if you need some more space. Don't block access to the course, though!\r\n\r\nFun fact: This treehouse was building by an engineering class, structural design, in 2011.  \r\n\r\nAfter setting up camp, make yourselves lunch!  Set-up camp & have lunch! Please keep this area clean though - we share it with the community. After lunch, take the short walk to the High Ropes Course to meet Oak Hill Croo. After lunch, be sure to bring SNACKS and WATER! \r\n**Be ready to meet them no later than 2pm!**\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, your trip will do the LOW ropes course, which is a lot of fun!  Oak Hill Croo will work with you & your trip, but YOU are the trip leader, so don't hesitate to jump in there when you notice a trippee needing something or you think it's time for a break.  The low ropes is (obviously) less of an adrenaline rush than the High Ropes Course, so it's important that you & your co-leader set a good tone & maintain the positive energy!\r\n\r\nAfter you're done & de-briefed with Oak Hill Croo, you can return to your campsite and get dinner ready.  It's a big day tomorrow, so get some sleep!\r\n\r\n**Meet Oak Hill Croo by 2:00 PM. Don't be late!!**", "description_day2": "Wake up & get breakfast started. You should be finished with breakfast & meet Oak Hill Croo by 9:00am at the High Ropes Course. All you & your trippees need is water, some snacks, and your med kit. Everyone NEEDS close-toed shoes and comfortable clothing -- you'll all be wearing climbing harnesses, so keep that in mind!\r\n\r\nBreak your trip into 2 groups, 1 co-leader should go with each group. If a trippee is nervous about heights, you can assign them to the group that will do the lower part of the course first.  1 Oak Hill Croo member will be with each group and facilitate the Ropes Course -- it will be awesome! \r\n\r\nBe very aware of how your trippees are doing & feeling. Call for breaks whenever you want! There's no rush and it's not a sprint, so go at a pace that works for your group.  You'll finish 1 part of the course and the 2 groups will swap and do the other 50% of the course.  Safety on the ropes course is SO important, so be sure to follow all of Oak Hill Croo's rules!\r\n\r\nAfter the ride, head back to your campsite and have lunch. Chill and relax with your trip - ropes coursing is tiring!\r\n\r\nThere are a number of fun activities you can do with your trip this afternoon. Get a sense of how they are feeling and decide what is best. You have a few hours of free time!\r\n\r\n-Swimming at Storr's Pond (**See swimming notes below!).

Take a left turn onto the road down towards Storr's Pond.  Go into the first parking lot on your right.  Go all the way to back of that parking lot and there's a building that has a gate to the right of it (gate may be open or closed).  Go through (or around) the gate and head to the second building (looks like a garage).  Take a left immediately after the second building, and walk to the back of the building.  There's a little trail that leads up a little trail behind that building.  At the top of this little hill is an old chimney.  Keep going past the chimney to the clearing.  \r\nSection A - There may be some logs and stuff you have to move out of the way in order to have enough space to set up a tarp\r\nOther sections - Thank section A for clearing those for you!\r\n\r\nYou're going to be camping here both nights, so set up a sweet camp and enjoy the rest of your evening!", "description_day2": "Today you will be hiking without your packs!

If people don't have day packs, either you, your co-leader or a trippee may need to bring a pack with food.  \r\n\r\nYou will meet John Taylor, the director of the Upper Valley Trails Alliance, at 9 or 9:30 at the Woodsmen's shed. Check in with him about your group's energy level, what you feel like doing. The UVTA is an awesome local organization which came together in 1995 to consolidate trailwork efforts in the Upper Valley (their inaugural meeting was in Tom Dent Cabin, which you passed yesterday). Their vision is all about sharing trailwork with people, old and young, so that more and more people can have a meaningful way to engage with the local landscape, and can know that trails don't come out of nowhere. Trailwork can be anything from moving a stick to building a bridge. John will do a short 1-2 hour workshop / walk in the woods with your group, if you all feel up to it, and will explain the principles of trailwork and how to do some stuff on the trail that you will be walking to Balch Hill today. He is a lovely person. \r\n\r\nHead out onto the road you hiked in on. Take a right onto reservoir road at the stop sign and go over the bridge. Take your first left (where you noted the trailhead as you hiked in yesterday). Head up what appears to be the driveway to this house, but keep to the left onto the trail. You will pass a swing on your right.  Follow this trail through the woods until it intersects with the Maple Trail on your right (if you hit a gravel cul-de-sac you've gone too far). Take a right onto the Maple Trail. Maple Trail will take you to the summit of Balch Hill following the blue and white dash marks on trees and the blue arrows. Enjoy the summit of Balch Hill and have lunch up there if you want. Feel free to play around on any of the other trails or the great climbing tree at the summit (this is also a great spot to have your friends raid your trip!).\r\n\r\nIf people want to do more hiking, head down the Grasse Traill, take a left onto the Hunter East Trail.  Follow that to the Garipay trail, and take a left onto the Garipay trail, and then a right back onto the Maple Trail to head back down the way you came.  \r\n\r\nIf you don't want to do a longer loop, just head straight back down the Maple trail the way you came up. Make sure to stay right when to trail splits to Maple trail to the right and Fire Trail to the left.

There may be water running nearby the shelter, but you might need to step slightly off the trail to find a decent place to fill up (and use iodine, of course).\r\n\r\nThere is an outhouse ~100 yards from the shelter (follow the signs).

However, we have a limited supply, and so we encourage you to first ask friends & family members to see if you can borrow these items.  Please refer to our website for more information about borrowing equipment from DOC First-Year Trips.  \r\n\r\nREQUIRED: (you can borrow a sleeping bag, pack, and pad from DOC First-Year Trips for free if you don't have one or want to purchase one)\r\n\r\n- A comfortable means of carrying all your stuff for up to 1 mile. This could be a duffel bag, sports bag or a frame pack (internal or external). If you have a pack bring it, it's more comfortable to carry stuff that way\r\n- A daypack for exploring once overnight gear has been dropped off\r\n- Heavy duty, broken-in*,  shoes for walking around outside (they will get DIRTY) -- you can use either hiking boots or sneakers for a cabin camping trip\r\n- Sleeping bag (synthetic or down, not cotton or flannel lined -- pack it in a stuffsack lined with a plastic bag)\r\n- Foam sleeping pad or thermarest \r\n- Wool sweater or fleece pullover\r\n- Raincoat or poncho \r\n- One pair long pants (wool or synthetic to insulate when wet -- NOT blue jeans or cotton sweatpants)\r\n- 2 pairs heavy socks (preferably wool)\r\n- 2 t-shirts\r\n- 2 underwear\r\n- 2 pairs hiking, biking or gym shorts\r\n- Warm long-sleeved shirt (wool or synthetic material to insulate when wet)\r\n- Flashlight or headlamp with extra batteries\r\n- Wool or fleece hat\r\n- Gloves or mittens\r\n- Bathing suit\r\n- Small towel\r\n- Plastic bowl, cup, and utensils\r\n- 2 plastic water bottles (at least one liter each, not a small disposable water bottle)\r\n- Sunscreen and Insect Repellent\r\n- 2 large plastic bags (i.e. trash bags; one to cover your pack in the rain)\r\n- Several smaller ziploc-style bags\r\n- Toiletries: toothbrush, small toothpaste (you don't need more than this! No razors, makeup, hairdryers, etc.)\r\n\r\n*If you decide to buy new boots or work-shoes, spare yourself the agony of big blisters and have them well broken-in before your trip by taking several long walks or hikes in your new shoes. You WILL get blisters if you don't wear them in first.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL:\r\n- LUNCH for the first day! You won't get dinner until 6pm on the day you arrive, so make sure you have food for when you are traveling to Hanover. \r\n- bandanna, pocket knife, compass, camera, sunglasses, wind or rain pants, harmonica, journal, etc.\r\n- One pair sneakers or sport sandals (for in camp)\r\n\r\nPROVIDED BY US:\r\n- cooking equipment, first aid kit, stove, and all other group gear.\r\n\r\nNOT ALLOWED:\r\n- firearms, private food, iPods, radios, TV sets, cellular phones, alcoholic beverages or non-medical drugs, garden gnomes.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n- If you have allergic reactions (bee stings, peanuts, etc.), we ask that you acquire an epinephrine kit from your doctor, and if you have an athletic brace, remember to bring it!\r\n- The rivers and lakes of New Hampshire get quite chilly by September, and weather in New Hampshire is unpredictable. It can be quite hot during the day but it gets COLD at night. Even if you're roasting in your town's summer heat right now, prepare for some chilly nights on your trip by bringing warm, non-cotton clothes. If you bring the proper clothing, you will remain toasty warm, even while wet. Don't cut corners on things like hats, sunscreen and warm, non-cotton layers.\r\n- The COTTON issue: You should avoid bringing cotton clothing as your warm clothing in the woods. Think about throwing your favorite cotton sweatshirt in cold water and then putting it on to keep warm -- it's heavy and doesn't insulate. Late summer is likely to be wet at least some of the time, and therefore you should provide for your own comfort and warmth by bringing a long-sleeved top and bottom layer that is not cotton. Any kind of synthetic material will work, as will wool. Don't be afraid to wear an old wool shirt or thermal underwear! Better to be wet and warm than wet and cold!\r\n- Line your bag with a plastic trash bag and pack your clothes in plastic bags as well. In the event of rain you will be thrilled to have some dry clothes and a dry sleeping bag in camp.\r\n- Remember, if you do not have the proper equipment, try borrowing it from a friend or check out your local Army/Navy surplus store. You don't need the top-of-the-line, Himalayan expedition-caliber gear; just make sure it's functional and relatively light. Much excellent wool and polyester can be had for next to nothing at Salvation Army and Goodwill.\r\n- If you have gear questions, contact your local outdoor outfitter such as EMS or REI.

Think about throwing your favorite cotton sweatshirt in cold water and then putting it on to keep warm -- it's heavy and doesn't insulate. Late summer is likely to be wet at least some of the time, and therefore you should provide for your own comfort and warmth by bringing a long-sleeved top and bottom layer that is not cotton. Any kind of synthetic material will work, as will wool. Don't be afraid to wear an old wool shirt or thermal underwear! Better to be wet and warm than wet and cold!\r\n- Line your bag with a plastic trash bag and pack your clothes in plastic bags as well. In the event of rain you will be thrilled to have some dry clothes and a dry sleeping bag in camp.\r\n- Remember, if you do not have the proper equipment, try borrowing it from a friend or check out your local Army/Navy surplus store. You don't need the top-of-the-line gear; just make sure it's functional and relatively light.
