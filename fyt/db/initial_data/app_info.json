    "application_header": "Welcome to the First-Year Trips Croo and Trip Leader application!  We hope this application will provide you with an opportunity to reflect on your time at Dartmouth and share some of your thoughts about building community here.  Everyone can play a role in welcoming new students to Dartmouth, so through this application we are hoping to gain an understanding of what you might bring to the role of a Trip Leader or croo member in order to create an inclusive, thoughtful, fun, and safe Trips experience this year. We would like to emphasize that there is no specific \u201ctype\u201d of person who would make a good Trip Leader or Croo member. You do not have to be \u201coutdoorsy\u201d or extroverted. We consider anyone and everyone.  That being said, we are looking for people who are thoughtful and genuine in their responses. \r\n\r\nWe encourage you to apply for both Trip Leader and Croos as the applications are very similar. Some questions on the Croo and the Leader applications are identical. You may use the same answers on both apps for those questions. But MAKE SURE the questions are the exact same before reusing an answer. \r\n\r\nA team of reviewers who have prior experience with the Trips program will read your application and assign a score. Applications will be read blind. The first section of this application (general info, demographics, activities, and additional info) will not be seen by reviewers, and will only be used in Croo and Trip Leader Assignments.\r\n\r\nNote: There is no \"submit\" button. Instead, save your application every time you make a change. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://outdoors.dartmouth.edu/firstyear/writing_tips.html\">Check out these tips for writing a brilliant Trips application</a>",
