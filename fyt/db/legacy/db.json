About half a mile downstream, the Swift Diamond River (which runs through the Grant) joins the Magalloway. After another 2 miles you'll pass under the Route 16 bridge. When you enter a large marshy area, be sure to stay on the main river. If you're in doubt, go straight or slightly left; there is one very confusing junction where you go straight - make no sharp right or left turns. After a stretch of many houses on the right bank, make a sharp right turn where there will be more houses on the right. Around another bend, you'll see the paved road again (Route 16). After this point, continue straight along the right bank for about one mile. The river will swell out on the left, with a small island in the middle. Stay on the right. Continue on the main river past another marshy area, toward Lake Umbagog. You have a beautiful afternoon stretch of water ahead of you now, and huge wildlife viewing potential! Paddle down the Magalloway toward Lake Umbagog. Watch out for marshy areas on either side - particularly a large pool on the right; the Magalloway runs fairly straight. Take care around the marshy junction of the Magalloway and big, wide Lake Umbagog; the landmarks can be confusing and you might miss the well protected nesting site of the only known wild living bald eagles in New Hampshire. \r\n\r\nLunch note: There is a park ranger station with a bathroom/dock that makes for a perfect stop around lunchtime. It comes on the right hand side of the river on a hard left turn (it's hard to miss). It's about halfway between the airstrip and your 2nd camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n----2014 CAMPSITE INFO-----\r\n\r\nSections A-D, and F-J -- please use campsite R31:\r\n\r\nOnce you have paddled into the lake, stay on the western bank and head south. The map shows you looping more than you need to - HUG THE BANK AND STAY STRAIGHT! Continue south beyond the mouth of the Androscoggin on the right (marked with a red-orange flag), around the point and past the little island. Keep canoeing past the point south, passing Molls Rock. Your campsite will be labeled R31, this is your campsite! Pay careful attention to the map and be patient. Look at your search as an adventure and an opportunity to paddle in a beautiful lake! The campsites are numbered with white paint on the rocks, the numbers are about four inches high. Once you have found your site, you can head ashore and set up camp or continue exploring in your canoes. If you have time, paddle across Lake Umbagog to the Maine side for some sightseeing. Campsite R31 is a little north of where indicated on the map, so if you do not see R31 at first, check a little further north. \r\n\r\n**SECTION E** -- AUGUST 31 - SEPTEMBER 1 -- please use campsite R28 (section E only!):\r\n\r\nCampsite R28 is much closer to the mouth of the Magalloway than R31. As you come down the river into the marshy junction with Umbagog, keep an eye out for the first major channel through the left bank of the river. Go through the channel and then go left again around the peninsula that formed the river left bank of the Magalloway (it might look more like the mainland than a extension of it). As you continue straight with the peninsula on your left (now heading north) there will also be a smallish island on your right. R28 will on the lefthand side near Leonard Pond.

Stay straight, hug the land on your right, and mouth of the Androscoggin will be on your right (probably sooner than you expect). Keep an eye out for the orangish-red flag that Grant Croo will used to mark the right turn.\r\n\r\nOnce you are confident that you are actually on the Androscoggin, paddle downriver towards the Errol Dam. About a mile before the dam, the river swells out. Continue to where you meet log lengths in the river, directing boats away from the dam, which is now about a quarter mile downstream (hear it humming!) Stay left of the logs. Ahead, there is a paved boat ramp on the left bank. This is where you take out - do not approach the dam. Your pick up time is listed above.  Please be early!!

Route 16 soon runs parallel to the river. Note the \"Moose Crossing\" sign on the left bank! Once the road turns away from the river, you'll enter a marshy area - just stay on the widest part of the river. Soon you will see the Diamond Peaks ahead. These formations are in the Second College Grant, where you'll be spending the night. Continue on the river until you have left the Diamond Peaks behind you. The river will bend gently left and off of the right bank is a large blow down with trees and a huge pile of rocks. This comes up quicker than expected so start looking for the pile of rocks as soon as you start paddling. Park your canoes on the downstream side of the blow down. Climb the bank and make camp on or along the Miller/Quinn Memorial Landing Strip. If it looks like rain, try setting up canoe-tents that deflect rainwater because the trees are too dense for solid waterproof shelter in the event of a downpour. What are canoe-tents? Ask someone in Ledyard before you leave. Otherwise, make sure to pull your canoes far up on shore.

Really, any where downriver of the merge is best.  Remember, the cooler the water the better!\r\n   B) the Magalloway River via the Landing Strip:  There's some nice pools at the south end of the landing strip.  Or, if you cross over the strip and head down a gradual embankment, some nice fishing can be had off the banks of the Magalloway right there.  In this river, you'll find not only Trout, but also Bass or maybe even Perch!\r\n\r\n2) Fish Type: In the Swift Diamond and the Dead Diamond Rivers, you'll only find the typical NH Brook Trout, fully grown between 8 and 13 inches (though rumor has it that a 20 inch trout has been caught in the Grant recently).  These guys like cool water, so if you see a deep pool or shady spot to fish in, you'll have better luck finding them there.  If you really want to up your chances, try fishing early in the morning or later towards the evening - it's cooler at theses times, and the fish will be more active, after sleeping during the day to beat the morning heat.\r\n\r\nRestrictions:  In the area between the merge of the Diamond Rivers and their joining into the Magalloway, there's a catch-and-release policy in place. In all other parts of the Grant and surroundings, there's a two fish / day suggested limit.  Also in that area, you not allowed to use hooks with barbs.\r\n\r\nFly vs. not-Fly fishing:  The fishing gear that DOC Trips has is not fly fishing gear.  That said, if your trippees bring fly fishing gear and know how to use it, there's no reason why they can't!  Advise them (if they don't know already) that they'll be most successful with \"wet\" flies (so, the ones that sink underwater rather than float on top of it).  Going along with the \"trout like to be coooool\" theme, having the fly sink into the deeper, cooler water will give you better chances of finding a fish.  They're too hot to be playing around and jumping at the surface at this time of year.\r\n\r\nSWIMMING ON TRIPS:\r\n-Swimming is allowed ONLY if your trippee has taken and passed the swim test, and note the swimming ability of your trippees during the swim test.\r\n- If your trippee did not take the swim test but is comfortable swimming, they may be allowed to wade (wading does NOT equal swimming).

In 1860 he published a map of the White Mountains.  During the summers Guyot widely explored the Appalachian Mountain Range from New England to Georgia.

(And most of it is downhill!) The all-knowing AMC White Mountain Guide writes that \"the views from Bondcliff are unsurpassed in the White Mountains\". Hope for clear weather--\r\n    Head back up the campsite spur trail to the Bondcliff trail, continuing left (south) on the Bondcliff trail. After 0.2 miles, you'll reach the West Bond spur trail. Stash your gear out of sight and jaunt up this side trail for some wonderful vistas. The round trip is one mile, and it's worth it. Rejoin Bondcliff and travel half a mile to the summit of Mount Bond. Stop, ponder, and feel extremely lucky that you go to a school so close to the White Mountains. Be wary of this next part of the trail in bad weather, as it is fairly exposed for a mile or so. Continue on along the cliffs of Bondcliff (1.2 mi) and then descend 4.4 miles until you hit the Wilderness Trail. \r\n    Turn right and head 1.8 miles West on the Wilderness Trail towards Franconia Falls -- you'll be traveling next to the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River. Shortly after the Franconia Brook trail merges into the Wilderness Trail, you'll find a bridge leading over Franconia Brook. Hike across the bridge and then right (North) up a small path following the river upstream to Franconia Falls, the greatest waterslide in the Whites! Sit down and slide over the Falls! If you bring a lunch tray, these things are Disneyland + amazing. (IMPORTANT: be very careful at Franconia Falls.  People drown there every year--it can be very dangerous, esp. if the water level is high, so be extra vigilant.)\r\n\r\nYour next task is to find the your home for the night, the Franconia Brook Tentsite\u2013 Take the Wilderness Trail back the way you came, across the Franconia Brook Bridge. Just after you cross the bridge and see signs for the Wilderness boundary, there is a narrow trail leading to the right to cross the Pemigewasset River. Cross this river on big stones (you MAY have to ford the river a little bit - it can be knee deep).  Be very careful, go slow, and be extra cautious.  Give Vox a call if you have any questions.  \r\n\r\nIF THE RIVER LOOKS MORE THAN KNEE DEEP DO NOT CROSS. Just camp on that side of the river 200 feet from the trail and walk out on the trail on that side of the river (there is a trail on either side of the river.\r\n\r\n You'll be at the north end of the campground (along the Eastside Trail) after you cross the river. If you have problems finding the campground OR the river is too dangerous to cross(be sure that you camp at least 200 ft. from the trail. If the river is above your knees it might not be worth crossing, if you do cross, have everyone unbuckle their packs, that way if they fall in they can get their pack off. Do not have them take their boots off unless they have sturdy soled sandals (like Tevas or Chacos)  not worth cutting your feet to keep your feet dry. \r\n\r\nThere have been reports of bears in this area so again plan on hanging a bear bag!\r\n\r\nNote: If you are moving slowly today, (ex. if there's some weather happening while you're descending from the Bondcliff, slowing things down), you can stop to make camp 1.8 miles before the Franconia Brook Tentsite, at the junction of Bondcliff Trail and Wilderness Trail.  Just across from that trail junction (just cross the Wilderness Trail, don't turn onto it) are some small, unmarked trails that lead down to the river and the old Camp 16 campsite (where Trip 57 has stayed in the past).  Camp 16 is no longer in use, so if you've decided to stay here for the night, try to find another suitable campsite near this area.  Be sure to camp at least 200 ft. from the trail AND the river.  Find a flat, clear site and set up your tarp.  Please do not build a campfire here (or at any other time on your trip).  From here, you have a 4.7 mile hike out tomorrow morning.

It will be well worth the time to follow the outlook trail to check out the Zeacliff outlook, it's spectacular. The outlook trail rejoins Twinway 50 yards down; continue on after soaking in the views and soon pass the Zeacliff Trail junction, remaining on Twinway. ~3.5 miles after the Zeacliff Trail, Twinway intersects with the Bondcliff trail.

Continue along the Desolation trail, climbing STEEPLY to the summit of Mt. Carrigain (1.9 mi). Make sure that you get enough water from the brook before you start. (There will NOT be any water on the mountain, no matter what the guidebooks tell you.) Admire the excellent view from the top of Mount Carrigain's fire tower, also a great place for lunch or a snack.

Once you're done taking in the view, return down the Desolation trail and repack for the second half of the day.\r\n\r\nReturn to the Carrigain Notch Trail and take what will now be a sharp left off Desolation (towards the northwest).  In less than a mile, you'll reach Stillwater Junction - turn left (south) to continue on the Wilderness Trail.  This section of the trail is a nice, flat mosey along the East Branch of the Pemi River.  2.6 miles past the Junction, you'll see the Thoreau Falls Trail diverge north from the Wilderness Trail.  About one mile beyond the Thoreau Trail you'll encounter the Pemi River again, as well as the site of a recently removed suspension bridge over the river.   DO NOT CROSS THE RIVER HERE.  Instead, turn left off the Wilderness Trail onto the Cedar Brook Trail.  After .6 miles, turn right off the Cedar Brook Trail onto the Pemi East Side Trail (this junction might be a bit overgrown, but there should be a sign that says \"East Side Trail\" to help you find the path).  Continue on this trail until you come to the Franconia Brook Tentsite (~2 miles).   (If you are gaining elevation and haven't seem the Pemi River in a while, you've hiked too far on Cedar Brook trail.)\r\n\r\nAt the Franconia Brook Tentsite there'\u00ads a ranger who knows about DOC Trips and will tell you where to set up camp.

At 1.8 miles, you'll pass the remains of the Lucy mill.

Please be respectful of other hikers at the shelter, and quiet down once it gets dark. Thru hikers have priority at any shelter along the AT, so set up your tarp first. If no thru hiker shows up, go ahead and sleep in the shelter, but have the tarp set up so that you can move if a thru hiker shows up late at night. Always be courteous, and report any negative interactions to the Lodj and the Trips Director once back on campus.

Here is an outline of your next few days out in the woods. \r\n\r\nOak Hill Croo (OHC) is here to support your trip and handle the skill instruction for mountain biking, but YOU are the leader and responsible for staying attune to group dynamics and overall fun-level of your trip.  Please be open with Oak Hill croo members about what your trip needs (physically, mentally, etc..).\r\n\r\nRemember that you're out most importantly to have some fun...not necessarily out to shred the (mountainbiking) gnar.  (Though, if you find some cool stuff and have some excited trippees, feel free to crush!) Also keep in mind this trip should be very beginner friendly!\r\n\r\n**2013 NOTE**\r\n-Some sections of this trip may be shuttled to the lodge by Oak Hill Croo. Check your trip description for more details & don't hesitate to ask Oak Hill Croo for clarification.\r\n-Bring extra water and fill up often! \r\n\r\nOther news:\r\n\u2022\tBikes: Bikes should stay with Oak Hill Croo (don't ride away with them!). They can assist you in any needed repairs.\r\no\tOn that note, please treat the bikes nicely as other sections will need to use them. \r\n\u2022\tCampsite: Your campsite is in the Storr's Pond Recreational area, which is not owned by Dartmouth. Please remind your trip to be respectful, not too loud at night, and be super friendly to the local community members who you come in contact with.\r\n\u2022\tBathrooms: There is a porta potty behind the shed by the gate at Oak Hill, this is your bathroom, don't poop in the woods. There are also Storrs Pond bathrooms you can walk down to from your campsite. \r\n\u2022\tEmergencies: Oak Hill Croo can help you out with most issues (i.e. not sure where to hike, need to know what time you're being picked up, etc...) But you should still CALL VOX in case of an emergency. Vox Croo is best equipped to coordinate any sort of emergency response. \r\n\u2022\tPhones: Yes, there is cell reception for most of this trip, but please do NOT use your cellphone unless it's an emergency or a Vox call.

We suggest you or your co-leader bring a daypack/small backpack to wear while riding, but your trippees don't necessarily need to.\r\n\r\nOHC will go mountain biking with you in the morning. It will be awesome! Be very aware of how your trippees are doing and feeling. Call for water breaks or snack breaks whenever you want! If someone looks like they are not having a great time, offer to slow down and walk with them or take a break to chat with them.

There may be some trees crossing the trail, so if you need to climb over a tree have your trippees remove their packs. You will pass several private staircases/docks that belong to Hanover residents. You will cross a clearing that is right at the bank of the river.

You'll come to a roundabout that has the Co-op market on the corner. If your trip needs water, go inside and fill up! Then you\u2019re going to continue down Rt. 10. Before the second roundabout, make a right down the gravel road (gate may be closed) right across from Rivercrest and after the Dartmouth printing company. Follow this trail into the forest. At the fork in the trail, at the bottom of the hill, stay left and continue following the trail along the pond. You will pass campsite L and then arrive at the sports fields and picnic pavilion. Keep following the trail and you will pass the Boy Scout Area, which is a spacious camping area with a wooden lean-to. Keep walking and you will encounter two forks, Keep right at both forks so the high ropes course stays on your left. You should then arrive at the Girl Scout Area, which is not marked but which will have a large green nylon tarp set up for you to use (you will still need to use your one plastic tarp as a ground cover).

Walk to the right of Tom Dent Cabin and you will see the start of the Cliff Side Trail. This trail follows the river and connects to Pine Park.\r\n\r\nStay on the Cliff Side Trail for a little over 2.0 miles. This trail can be a little narrow and slippery, so go slowly and be careful. There may be some trees crossing the trail, so if you need to climb over a tree have your trippees remove their packs. You will pass several private staircases/docks that belong to Hanover residents. You will cross a clearing that is right at the bank of the river. Do not turn right into the ravine (it's not a trail), but this can be a great place to take a break and wade into the river (ONLY if your trippees passed the swim test!). Keep in mind you need to be ready to go for the low ropes course by 2pm!\r\n\r\nAt 2.15 miles, you will come across a small brown building with green pads on the corners and the junction of several trails.

At a small fork, stay on the trail by bearing slightly to the left. \r\n\r\nAt ~2.75 miles, the trail turns slightly to the right, away from the river (stay on the wide path). At the Y-shaped intersection, go left down the little hill. After 0.2 miles, you will come to an intersection shaped like a triangle. Go right to cross the stream/stream bed, NOT left up the big hill. \r\n\r\nYou will pass under a bridge overhead. After going under that bridge, take a left through some grass to go up the hill to the golf course. Stay left on the path and head towards the red dirt path in front of you. Be very careful as you will be passing by tees and you don't want to interrupt anyone's game (or get hit!). This path will turn into grass. Get on the paved golf cart path and head to the left. Once you get to the water cooler, take the right fork towards the road (Rt. 10). Don't take a break on the golf course\u2014try to get out of the way and off the course quickly!\r\n\r\nTake a left onto Rt. 10 and stay on the sidewalk. You'll come to a roundabout that has the Co-op market on the corner. If your trip needs water, go inside and fill up! Take a right onto Reservoir Road, past the intersection with Hemlock Street (you will have passed the rugby fields & an elementary school). Continue on Reservoir Road until you come across Storr's Pond Road. Make a sharp LEFT and enter the Storr's Pond Recreation Area. \r\n\r\nGo into the first parking lot on your right. Go all the way to back of that lot and there's a building that has a gate to the right of it (gate may be open or closed). Go through or around this gate and continue straight up to the field. You will pass the Woodsmen's Area on your left. Note: You may see Oak Hill Croo up to shenanigans with another trip. Try not to interrupt them. We promise, you will have tons of time to wreak havoc of your own with them!\r\n\r\nStraight across the field there is a wide mowed trail going up the hill, follow that trail straight (NOT to the base of the ski jump, but up the hill). At the top of the hill, take a left (ignore the one way sign, that's for skiing). Continue on this wide trail for about 0.3 miles. Then you will see a smaller side trail to the left going down hill. Follow this trail down, and take a right at the bottom of it. \r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, you will see a treehouse. This is your camp for the trip!\r\nThere will be a permanent green nylon tarp set up for you to use - the plastic tarp you brought is for use as a groundcloth. \r\n \r\nFun fact: an engineering class, called Structural Design, built This treehouse in 2011. \r\n\r\nAfter setting up camp, make yourselves lunch! Please keep this area clean though - we share it with the community. After lunch, take the short walk to the high ropes course to meet OHC. Be sure to bring SNACKS and WATER! \r\n**Be at the high ropes course no later than 2pm**\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, your trip will do the LOW ropes course, which is a lot of fun! OHC will work with you and your trip, but YOU are the trip leader, so don't hesitate to jump in there when you notice a trippee in need or you think it's time for a break. The low ropes is less of an adrenaline rush than the high ropes course, but is quite challenging in other ways. It\u2019s very important that you and your co-leader set a good tone, and maintain the positive energy on both the low and high courses!\r\n\r\nAfter you're done and de-briefed with Oak Hill Croo, you can return to your campsite and get dinner ready.

Also keep in mind this trip should be very beginner friendly. \r\n\r\n**2014 NOTE**\r\n\u2022\tSome sections of this trip may be shuttled to the lodge by OHC. Check your trip description for more details and don't hesitate to ask OHC for clarification.\r\n\u2022\tBring extra water and fill up often! \r\n\r\nOther News:\r\n\u2022\tBikes: Bikes should stay with Oak Hill Croo (don't ride away with them!). They can assist you in any needed repairs.\r\no\tOn that note, please treat the bikes nicely as other sections will need to use them. \r\n\u2022\tCampsite: Your campsite is in the Storr's Pond Recreational area, which is not owned by Dartmouth. Please remind your trip to be respectful, not too loud at night, and be super friendly to the local community members who you come in contact with.\r\n\u2022\tBathrooms: There is a porta potty behind the shed by the gate at Oak Hill, this is your bathroom, don't poop in the woods. There are also Storrs Pond bathrooms you can walk down to from your campsite. \r\n\u2022\tEmergencies: Oak Hill Croo can help you out with most issues (i.e. not sure where to hike, need to know what time you're being picked up, etc...) But you should still CALL VOX in case of an emergency. Vox Croo is best equipped to coordinate any sort of emergency response. \r\n\u2022\tPhones: Yes, there is cell reception for most of this trip, but please do NOT use your cellphone unless it's an emergency or a Vox call. There's plenty of time to text your friends after the trip!\r\n\u2022\tSwim Test: Encourage your trippees to take the swim test, so they can enjoy Storrs Pond. \r\n", "campsite1": 52, "non_swimmers_allowed": true, "trips_year": 2015, "description_conclusion": "Thru Hiker Notes\r\n\r\nPlease be respectful of other hikers at the shelter, and quiet down once it gets dark. Thru hikers have priority at any shelter along the AT, so set up your tarp first.

Always be courteous, and report any negative interactions to the Lodj and the Trips Director once back on campus.\r\n\r\nSwimming Notes\r\n\r\n-Swimming is allowed ONLY if your trippee has taken and passed the swim test, and note the swimming ability of your trippees during the swim test.\r\n- If your trippee did not take the swim test but is comfortable swimming, they may be allowed to wade (wading does NOT equal swimming).

All you and your trippees need is water, some snacks, and your med kit. We suggest you or your co-leader bring a daypack/small backpack to wear while riding, but your trippees don't necessarily need to.\r\n\r\nOHC will go mountain biking with you in the morning. It will be awesome! Be very aware of how your trippees are doing and feeling. Call for water breaks or snack breaks whenever you want! If someone looks like they are not having a great time, offer to slow down and walk with them or take a break to chat with them. Remember, this is not about completing all the trails, but making sure your trippees are having a good time and getting out of their comfort zone in a safe way.  \r\n\r\nDon't be afraid to let OHC know when you think it's time to stop (even if it's earlier than expected).

Ask OHC members to show you if you're not sure where to go.\r\n\u2022\tVolleyball: Near the pool, there is a volleyball court. OHC can lend you a volleyball (but be sure to return it!) if you want to play with your trippees.\r\n\u2022\tSlackline: There is usually a slackline by the pond. Hopefully it\u2019s still there! \r\n\r\nMake sure not to start dinner too late, as you will be joining OHC for a campfire hangout session at the Woodsmen\u2019s Arena, complete with s\u2019mores, music, and good conversation. The session will start between 8 and 9PM and last for about an hour. OHC will touch base with you after the high ropes course to confirm the time. Please try to get there at the time requested.

You can walk down West Wheelock St. toward the river and turn right into the parking lot near the Swim Docks/Boathouse. Walk through the parking lot, past the rowing boathouse, and continue down the driveway between the two white buildings, toward Tom Dent Cabin. Walk to the right of Tom Dent Cabin and you will see the start of the Cliff Side Trail. This trail follows the river and connects to Pine Park.\r\n\r\nStay on the Cliff Side Trail for a little over 2.0 miles. This trail can be a little narrow and slippery, so go slowly and be careful. There may be some trees crossing the trail, so if you need to climb over a tree have your trippees remove their packs. You will pass several private staircases/docks that belong to Hanover residents. You will cross a clearing that is right at the bank of the river. Do not turn right into the ravine (it's not a trail), but this can be a great place to take a break and wade into the river (ONLY if your trippees passed the swim test!). Keep in mind you need to be ready to mountain bike by 2pm!\r\n\r\nAt 2.15 miles, you will come across a small brown building with green pads on the corners and the junction of several trails. There will be three trails ahead of you -- take the middle trail and continue straight. At a small fork, stay on the trail by bearing slightly to the left. \r\n\r\nAt ~2.75 miles, the trail turns slightly to the right, away from the river (stay on the wide path). At the Y-shaped intersection, go left down the little hill. After 0.2 miles, you will come to an intersection shaped like a triangle. Go right to cross the stream/stream bed, NOT left up the big hill. \r\n\r\nYou will pass under a bridge overhead. After going under that bridge, take a left through some grass to go up the hill to the golf course. Stay left on the path and head towards the red dirt path in front of you. Be very careful as you will be passing by tees and you don't want to interrupt anyone's game (or get hit!). This path will turn into grass. Get on the paved golf cart path and head to the left. Once you get to the water cooler, take the right fork towards the road (Rt. 10). Don't take a break on the golf course\u2014try to get out of the way and off the course quickly!\r\n\r\nTake a left onto Rt. 10 and stay on the sidewalk. You'll come to a roundabout that has the Co-op market on the corner. If your trip needs water, go inside and fill up! Then you\u2019re going to continue down Rt. 10. Before the second roundabout, make a right down the gravel road (gate may be closed) right across from Rivercrest and after the Dartmouth printing company. Follow this trail into the forest. At the fork in the trail, at the bottom of the hill, stay left and continue following the trail along the pond. You will pass campsite L and then arrive at the sports fields and picnic pavilion. Keep following the trail to the Boy Scout Area. It is in the same direction as campsite M, but past it. (Refer to you map). It is not marked, but if you're on the bank of the pond in a spacious camping area with a wooden lean-to\u2014you are in the right place. There will be a green nylon tarp set up for you to use. The plastic tarp you brought is for underneath the A-frame.\r\n\r\nSet-up camp and have lunch! Please be sure to keep this site very clean. You're welcome to use the restroom building you passed on the path, but be respectful of the community members also using it. \r\n\r\nAfter lunch, you\u2019re going to head to Oak Hill to meet OHC. It's about 1 mile away - make sure to bring snacks and water! You\u2019re not going to go back the way you came. Instead keep following the trail you came to your campsite on (so basically return to the trail from your campsite and keep following the trail in the same direction). Keep right at both forks so the high ropes course stays on your left. You should pass the Girl Scout campsite (with a green tarp set up) and campsite #18. At the bottom of hill/end of the trail, you will hit a beach and pavilion area. Follow the dirt road all the way to the swimming pool area. Pass the pool and keep going up the road to the left. On your left, you'll see a parking lot right outside the entrance booth. Walk to the end of the parking lot near the gate. You will meet Oak Hill Croo for your mountain biking skills workshop. Be sure your trippees (and you) are dressed and prepared to do some basic biking. Definitely bring water & snacks, but not much else is needed. \r\n**Meet Oak Hill Croo by 2:00 PM.

However, if you don\u2019t see your bus here, it\u2019s very possible that they are waiting at Gate Camp, just across the river.

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE CABIN KEY BEFORE YOUR BUS LEAVES! Got it? Good. You now have a short 1.6 mile hike in front of you to get to Peaks Cabin \u2013 don\u2019t worry, most of it\u2019s flat! Continue north on the same dirt road (Dead Diamond), putting Gate Camp, the river crossing and Town Hall behind you. Keep going across the bridge and follow the road left as it hugs the Dead Diamond River\u2019s east bank (you should be traveling upstream).\r\n\r\nKeep following the road along the river and before long you\u2019ll see a low, longish building to the right \u2013 this is Peaks! If you reach the place where another river (the Swift Diamond) joins the Dead Diamond on your left, you\u2019ve gone too far.  To get in, use the key that Grant Croo gave you. Settle in, eat, and maybe play some games. \r\n\r\nOnce everyone is settled, feel things out to see if your trip is up for a little adventure in the afternoon. The area close to your cabin boasts some really cool spots and hidden treasures, many tied up with the storied lore of the Grant. This wilderness is your playground for the next few days! Know that BY NO MEANS do you have to do all of these sub-trips (in fact, you probably won\u2019t have the time). However, this is a hiking trip, so budget your time well, and make an effort get out there and explore this awesome corner of the world!\r\n\r\nDiamond Peaks: If your trip is feeling up to it either day, you can hike the main summit in the area \u2013 Diamond Peaks! To get to the Diamond Peaks Trailhead, head up Dead Diamond Rd. about 0.3 miles further past the cabin. The trail begins to the right of the road, just past the Management Center and near a parking lot. Hike up (it\u2019s steep but short!), and make sure to stop at the two great lookout spots on the way up (Alice\u2019s Ledge and Linda\u2019s Ledge). The trail is a little overgrown but well-marked \u2013 keep your wits about you and you\u2019ll do great. The top is 0.7 miles from the trailhead and affords some awesome views, as well as a great open area where your trip can eat lunch or just hang out. N.B. - just before the peak on the way up, the path branches off to the left into Diamond Back Trail \u2013 DO NOT TAKE THIS SPUR! It is very overgrown and will take you farther from home than you want to go. When you\u2019ve had your fill of the view return to Peaks the way you came, down the same trail and then left on Dead Diamond Rd.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack down Dead Diamond: Retracing your steps about 0.3 miles back down Dead Diamond Rd. toward Gate Camp you will find Diamond Gorge Lookout, where there is a sharp drop down to and a great view of the river. A little further down the road and on the left is Brungot\u2019s Spring, where you can fill up on water and swim if your trip is feeling it.\r\n\r\nOver to Swift Diamond and out: The parking lot on Dead Diamond Road where the Diamond Peak Trailhead begins there is also a T intersection with Swift Diamond Road. Follow Swift Diamond west and, about 1 mile from Peaks Cabin, you\u2019ll come upon the sign for the Hand-on-the-Rock. Follow the nearby trail a short ways upstream and check out the Rock. It\u2019s big, and it has a very mysterious carving on it of unknown origin\u2026 hmmm... aliens? Mother Nature? Trippees of ages long past? Head back to Swift Diamond Road and keep going west (ignoring the road that branches off to the right) to find Brungot\u2019s Lookout, a high ledge of land overlooking the Swift Diamond River on your left. The lookout is named for Sam Brungot, the Grant\u2019s Fire Warden in days of yore. This used to be where Sam would survey his domain for signs of fires. These days, though, it\u2019s just a great spot to have lunch and watch the world go by. When you\u2019re feeling done, retrace your steps the 2 miles back to Peaks.\r\n\r\nUp, up, up Dead Diamond: Last but not least, you can continue up Dead Diamond Rd. past the Diamond Peaks Trailhead to an interesting area farther up north. About 2 miles up the road you\u2019ll pass Merrill Brook Cabin on your right. Keep going until you pass a parking lot on your left and take an immediate left thereafter. You\u2019ll soon come to the river and a suspension bridge over it \u2013 just before the bridge is Monahan\u2019s bathtub, a pool in the Dead Diamond River off a nice ledge. Weather and temperature permitting, take a swim! Bob Monahan \u201929, former Dartmouth forester, did in fact swim here once upon a time. Just across the bridge is also Diamond Four Corners, the intersection of several old logging roads. Soak in the \u201ctub\u201d as long as you like, just remember that there is a roughly 3 mile hike back down to Peaks the way you came. This hike is flat but a much longer round trip (6 miles) than the others \u2013 you might want to save this whole trek for your one full day. \r\n"}, "pk": 68, "model": "trips.triptemplate"}, {"fields": {"trips_year": 2015, "name": "Cabin Camping", "leader_description": "Cabin Camping trips will be hiking on the DOC trail system and staying in cabins.

It can be quite hot during the day but it gets COLD at night. Even if you're roasting in your town's summer heat right now, prepare for some chilly nights on your trip by bringing warm, non-cotton clothes. If you bring the proper clothing, you will remain toasty warm, even while wet. Don't cut corners on things like hats, sunscreen and warm, non-cotton layers.\r\n- The COTTON issue: You should avoid bringing cotton clothing as your warm clothing in the woods. Think about throwing your favorite cotton sweatshirt in cold water and then putting it on to keep warm -- it's heavy and doesn't insulate. Late summer is likely to be wet at least some of the time, and therefore you should provide for your own comfort and warmth by bringing a long-sleeved top and bottom layer that is not cotton. Any kind of synthetic material will work, as will wool. Don't be afraid to wear an old wool shirt or thermal underwear! Better to be wet and warm than wet and cold!\r\n- Line your bag with a plastic trash bag and pack your clothes in plastic bags as well. In the event of rain you will be thrilled to have some dry clothes and a dry sleeping bag in camp.\r\n- Remember, if you do not have the proper equipment, try borrowing it from a friend or check out your local Army/Navy surplus store. You don't need the top-of-the-line, Himalayan expedition-caliber gear; just make sure it's functional and relatively light. Much excellent wool and polyester can be had for next to nothing at Salvation Army and Goodwill.\r\n- If you have gear questions, contact your local outdoor outfitter such as EMS or REI.

If you have questions, any outdoor retailer would be happy to help!)\r\n- Hiking boots or solid sneakers: well BROKEN-IN* (not brand-new), preferably ankle height, and sized to fit over wool socks.\r\n- Sleeping bag (synthetic or down, not cotton or flannel lined, and packed in a stuffsack lined with a plastic trash bag) \r\n- Foam sleeping pad or thermarest \r\n- Wool sweater or fleece pullover \r\n- Raincoat or poncho \r\n- One pair long pants (wool or synthetic to insulate when wet -- NOT blue jeans or cotton sweatpants) \r\n- 2 pairs heavy socks (preferably wool) \r\n- 2 t-shirts\r\n- 2 underwear \r\n- 2 pairs hiking, biking or gym shorts \r\n- Warm shirt (wool or synthetic material insulate when wet) \r\n- Flashlight or headlamp with extra batteries \r\n- Wool or fleece hat \r\n- Gloves or mittens \r\n- Bathing suit \r\n- Small towel \r\n- Plastic bowl and cup, spoon.\r\n- 2 plastic water bottles (at least one liter each, not a small disposable water bottle) \r\n- Sunscreen and Insect Repellent \r\n- 2 large plastic bags (one to cover your pack in the rain) \r\n- Several smaller ziploc-style bags \r\n- Toilet articles: toothbrush, small toothpaste (you don't need more than this! No razors, makeup, hairdryers, etc.) \r\n*If you decide to buy new boots or work-shoes, spare yourself the agony of big blisters and have them well broken-in before your trip by taking several long walks or hikes in your new shoes. You WILL get blisters if you don't wear them in first.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL:- LUNCH for the first day! You won't get dinner until 6pm on the day you arrive, so make sure you have food for when you are traveling to Hanover.\r\n- bandanna, pocket knife, compass, camera, sunglasses, wind or rain pants, harmonica, journal, etc.\r\n- One pair of sneakers or sport sandals (for in camp)\r\n\r\nPROVIDED BY US:\r\n- cooking equipment, first aid kit, stove, and all other group gear.\r\n\r\nNOT ALLOWED:\r\n- firearms, private food, cd players, iPods, radios, TV sets, cellular phones, alcoholic beverages or non-medical drugs, garden gnomes.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n- For your day on the cliffs, you really don't need any special footwear. Hiking boots or sneakers work just fine at the introductory level. If you do have rock shoes, bring them if you want to and still have room in your pack. If you don't have them, we will let you borrow some from us (for free).\r\n- If you have allergic reactions (bee stings, peanuts, etc.), we ask that you acquire an epinephrine kit from your doctor, and if you have an athletic brace, remember to bring it!\r\n- The rivers and lakes of New Hampshire get quite chilly by September, and weather in New Hampshire is unpredictable. It can be quite hot during the day but it gets COLD at night. Even if you're roasting in your town's summer heat right now, prepare for some chilly nights on your trip by bringing warm, non-cotton clothes. If you bring the proper clothing, you will remain toasty warm, even while wet. Don't cut corners on things like hats, sunscreen and warm, non-cotton layers.\r\n- The COTTON issue: You should avoid bringing cotton clothing as your warm clothing in the woods. Think about throwing your favorite cotton sweatshirt in cold water and then putting it on to keep warm -- it's heavy and doesn't insulate. Late summer is likely to be wet at least some of the time, and therefore you should provide for your own comfort and warmth by bringing a long-sleeved top and bottom layer that is not cotton. Any kind of synthetic material will work, as will wool. Don't be afraid to wear an old wool shirt or thermal underwear! Better to be wet and warm than wet and cold!\r\n- Line your bag with a plastic trash bag and pack your clothes in plastic bags as well. In the event of rain you will be thrilled to have some dry clothes and a dry sleeping bag in camp.\r\n- Remember, if you do not have the proper equipment, try borrowing it from a friend or check out your local Army/Navy surplus store. You don't need the top-of-the-line, Himalayan expedition-caliber gear; just make sure it's functional and relatively light. Much excellent wool and polyester can be had for next to nothing at Salvation Army and Goodwill.\r\n- If you have gear questions, contact your local outdoor outfitter such as EMS or REI.

The belt should fit snugly around your waist and the frame of the backpack should be similar to your torso size.

Think about throwing your favorite cotton sweatshirt in cold water and then putting it on to keep warm -- it's heavy and doesn't insulate. Late summer is likely to be wet at least some of the time, and therefore you should provide for your own comfort and warmth by bringing a long-sleeved top and bottom layer that is not cotton.

Think about throwing your favorite cotton sweatshirt in cold water and then putting it on to keep warm -- it's heavy and doesn't insulate. Late summer is likely to be wet at least some of the time, and therefore you should provide for your own comfort and warmth by bringing a long-sleeved top and bottom layer that is not cotton.
